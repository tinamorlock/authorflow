# Author Flow
## Overview
### Project Name
Author Flow
### Purpose
Author Flow gives authors a marketplace for the workflows
they need to make their writing, publishing, and marketing
processes simpler. From coming up with viable ideas all 
the way up to advertising their books on Amazon and Facebook,
it gives them the knowledge they need to make their careers
easier to navigate.

There are two sides to how this web app will work:

1. Authors can log on and add workflows to their database of templates.
2. They can also create unique workflows and either offer them for free in the marketplace or charge every time an author wants to add to their templates.

This solves a few problems in the publishing industry:
* It gives authors an opportunity to earn income for their advanced techniques that help them earn a living with their writing.
* It provides new authors with the foundational steps they need to get started.
* It guides authors of all levels through challenging concepts preventing them from achieving their goals.
* It provides a support systems for authors struggling to finish their projects.
### Audience
There are three primary audience sectors Author Flow will target:
1. Six-figure (and above) authors who have unique processes they'd like to teach for supplemental income.
2. New authors who need foundational knowledge to get them started writing their first book.
3. Existing authors who have published before but are struggling with a specific part of the publishing process.
#### Six-Figure Authors
It requires a lot of hard work to become a six-figure-earning author
in today's publishing industry. However, many authors in 
many genres have proven it's achievable with the right 
knowledge and effort. This knowledge is hard-won and sometimes 
unique to their particular brand, but that doesn't mean it won't 
work for others.

It also shouldn't always be given away.

Why might a six-figure author want to use Author Speak?
* They want to earn income in addition to the royalties from their books.
* They want to help other authors achieve success.
* They want to be seen as thought leaders in the genre, subgenre, or trope.
* They want to leave their mark as an author.
#### New Authors
Writing, publishing, and marketing book can feel extremely 
overwhelming to somebody who has never done it before. This often
leads them down twisty paths that don't always lead to 
success. Some authors are pretty capable and only need 
a well-planned road to travel on to get their career started. 
The knowledge they could gain on Author Flow could be life changing.

What are some reasons a new author might want to use Author Flow?
* They need help coming up with ideas, creating characters, world-building, etc.
* They could use some guidance in understanding the editing process.
* They aren't sure what tools they'll need throughout the writing and publishing processes.
* They are stuck and need some assistance finding their way through an obstacle.
#### Existing Authors
Existing authors live in that space between new and successful. They might even 
have the same amount (or more) of books the six-figure author has out,
yet they're lacking a process or workflow to get the success they seek. Their challenges
are likely a bit more nuanced than the new author, so they may require more advanced help.

Why might an existing author want to use Author Flow?
* They're trying to breathe life back into some old books that are no longer earning royalties.
* Their advertising strategy is expensive and not getting them the results they need.
* They're not earning enough income from their books.
* They want to learn creative marketing strategies for organic growth.
### Project Goals
1. Start building a viable MVP product that allows users to create sharable workflows.
2. Implement the ability to create new projects based on templates in their database.
3. Add ways to monetize templates. (Either through subscriptions and income sharing or commission for one-off template sales.)
4. Integrate an educational platform that allows successful authors to sell courses to other author members.
5. Allow successful authors to lead premium writing workshops.

Deadline goal for MVP: November 2025
